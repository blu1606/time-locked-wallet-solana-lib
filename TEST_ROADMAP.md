### Phase 3: Robustness (Week 3)
**Priority: MEDIUM** | **Risk: MEDIUM** | **Effort: High**

#### Comprehensive Coverage
1. **Stress and Performance** ‚≠ê‚≠ê
   - `tests/performance-benchmark-test.ts`

   - High volume operations
   - Concurrent access scenarios

2. **Network Compatibility** ‚≠ê
   - `tests/network-integration-test.ts`
   - Multi-RPC provider testing
   - Connection resilience
   - Different network conditions

### Phase 4: Integration & Polish (Week 4)
**Priority: LOW-MEDIUM** | **Risk: LOW** | **Effort: Medium**

#### Full Stack Validation
1. **SDK Integration** ‚≠ê
   - `tests/sdk-full-integration-test.ts`
   - React hooks testing
   - TypeScript compilation
   - Framework compatibility

2. **Documentation Validation** ‚≠ê
   - Verify all examples work
   - API reference accuracy
   - Integration guide testing

## üöÄ Quick Win Implementation Strategy

### Day 1: Immediate Security Validation
```bash
# Create basic account closure test
touch tests/account-closure-basic-test.ts

# Test plan:
# 1. Create SOL time-lock
# 2. Deposit funds
# 3. Wait for unlock
# 4. Withdraw and close
# 5. Verify account deletion + rent refund
```

### Day 2-3: Core New Features
```bash
# Test all new closure instructions
touch tests/closure-instructions-test.ts

# Test plan:
# 1. withdrawAndCloseSol
# 2. closeEmptyAccount  
# 3. closeTokenAccount
# 4. forceCloseExpired
```

### Day 4-5: Security Hardening
```bash
# Unauthorized access prevention
touch tests/security-unauthorized-test.ts

# Test plan:
# 1. Wrong owner attempts
# 2. Invalid signatures
# 3. PDA manipulation attempts
```

## üìã Risk Mitigation Strategy

### High-Risk Areas (Test First)
1. **Account Closure Logic** - New code, complex state changes
2. **Rent Reclaim Mechanism** - Financial implications
3. **Authorization Checks** - Security critical
4. **Time Lock Validation** - Core business logic

### Medium-Risk Areas (Test Second)
1. **Event Emission** - Observable behavior
2. **Error Handling** - User experience
3. **Gas Optimization** - Performance impact

### Low-Risk Areas (Test Last)
1. **Documentation Examples** - Non-functional
2. **SDK Convenience Methods** - Wrappers around core
3. **Framework Integration** - External dependencies

## üéØ Success Metrics

### Quantitative Goals
- **Zero critical bugs** in production
- **< 1% test failure rate** in CI/CD
- **95%+ code coverage** for new features
- **100% security scenario coverage**

### Qualitative Goals
- **High confidence** in production deployment
- **Clear documentation** of all tested scenarios
- **Maintainable test suite** for future development
- **Fast feedback loop** for developers
