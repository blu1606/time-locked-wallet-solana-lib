# Time-Locked Wallet Frontend

A modern React/TypeScript frontend application for creating time-locked wallets on Solana. This application allows users to lock their own SOL and SPL tokens with a specific unlock time, ensuring funds can only be withdrawn after the lock period expires.

## 🚀 Features

- **Self-Locking Wallets**: Lock your own tokens with custom unlock timestamps
- **Multi-Asset Support**: Support for SOL and SPL tokens (USDC)
- **Tabbed Dashboard**: Easy switching between locked, ready to withdraw, and completed transactions
- **Wallet Integration**: Connect with Phantom, Solflare, and other Solana wallets
- **Dark Mode**: Beautiful dark/light theme toggle (default dark)
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first design with Tailwind CSS
- **Devnet Airdrop**: Request SOL and USDC from devnet faucet
- **Production Ready**: Optimized build with proper error handling

## 🛠 Tech Stack
